This is a web app intended as a PoC to explore using AI language models (LLMs / SLMs) to help stroke patients (specifically patients with Anomia), to think of the words they are searching for when they are speaking. Given that such models work on the basis of predicting the next word in sequence, this app explores the capability for these models to understand the patient, identify pauses when they might be trying to think of a word, and suggest potential words.
